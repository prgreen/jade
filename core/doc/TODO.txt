- Units tests for jade events.
- Authentication scheme (and admin rights) for jade events.
- SFML helper for jade events.
- Helper functions to wait for a number of ticks/second, wait for an event with a timeout. Check possibility of using several triggers for a same function.
- "Jade objects" that retain which coroutines belong to them, intercomm and pub/sub. Maybe use middleclass
- An admin console to execute arbitrary lua commands while program is running
- Security: no random string should crash the event system. Spammers should be IP banned.


- Have a "patcher" library to download and patch new games from a server automatically.
- Have a compression library like physfs.
- Use compressed bytecode instead of visible scripts.

- True lua async io with a thread pool, maybe libev-libeio
